[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

AUTHOR NOTES:
- For the image placement I used:
     position: absolute
     bottom: 2.5rem
     right: 2.5rem

     so it will be always on the bottom right

- used grid for the desktop view
    > I have 3 columns and 2 rows
    > I've offset the first and last card through:
        transform: translateX(8.75rem)
